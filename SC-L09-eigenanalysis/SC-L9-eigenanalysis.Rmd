## Why numerical linear algebra?

- Difference between linear algebra and **applied** linear algebra.
- Think about linear algebra in Statistics.
- In curve fitting.
- In image processing.
- In signal processing.
- etc.

# We need to know numerical techniques!





## Eigenanalysis

- In general, a matrix acts on a vector by changing both its magnitude and its direction.
- However, a matrix may act on certain vectors by changing only their magnitude, and leaving their direction unchanged (or reversing it).
    - these vectors are the eigenvectors of the matrix
    - the scaling factor is the eigenvalue.

## Example

- Think about the linear transformation $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}$, where 

$$\mathbf{A} = \left(\begin{array}{cc}
   2 & 0\\
   0 & 3
   \end{array}\right),~\mathbf{x} = \left(\begin{array}{c}
   \cos\theta \\
   \sin\theta 
   \end{array}\right),~\mathbf{y} =\left(\begin{array}{c}
   y_1 \\
   y_2 
   \end{array}\right).$$

- What is its geometric interpretation?

- What happens when $\theta = \frac{\pi}{4}$?

- When $\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}$?

- When $\theta = 0$?

## Example

- What if $\mathbf{A}$ is not diagnal?
- How to find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors?
- If $\mathbf{A}$ is a real symmetric matrix
    - Only real eigenvalues
    - $n$ distinct linearly independent eigenvectors
    - pairwise orthogonal
    - $\mathbf{A = Q\Lambda Q^T}$
- When $A$ is diagonalisable?
- If a diagonalisation doesn't exist, there is always a triangularisation via Schur Decomposition: $\mathbf{A = QSQ^T}$.    
- Let us revisit together the properties of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. 

## What does eigenanalysis help to do?

- Let's try to understand what $\mathbf{Ax} = \lambda \mathbf{x}$ is really asking.
- Can we find a pair of $\lambda$ and $\mathbf{x}$ such that when a matrix $\mathbf{A}$ is applied to $\mathbf{x}$, it doesn't change the direction and just scales the vector?
- If we can find such a pair, then everytime we do something with $\mathbf{Ax}$ in some mathematical operation, we can replace it with $\lambda \mathbf{x}$.

## What does eigenanalysis help to do?

- Consider $\mathbf{A} = \left(\begin{array}{cc}
   5 & -1\\
   -2 & 4
   \end{array}\right)$ and $\mathbf{x} = \left(\begin{array}{c}
   1 \\
   -1 
   \end{array}\right)$. 
    - what if we now want to calculate $\mathbf{A^{20}x}$?
    - what if we now want to calculate $\mathbf{A^{-1}x}$?
    
- Computationally, we would rather work with scalars than matrices and this is what eigenanalysis helps us do.
- But what if we are not lucky enough to be asked to multiply a matrix by one of its eigenvectors?

## Advantages of eigenanalysis

- It enables us to replace a matrix with a scalar when we have the opportunity to change our coordinate system to the eigenvectors of a matrix.
- We can express any vector in terms of this new coordinate system.
- We can use the fact that $\mathbf{Ax} = \lambda \mathbf{x}$ to simplify calculations.

## Application of Eigenanalysis: Google

## How to know page rank?

- How does the search engine know which pages are the most important?
- Google assigns a number to each individual page, expressing its importance. 
- This number is known as the PageRank and is computed via the eigenvalue problem $Aw = \lambda w$, where $A$ is based on the link structure of the Internet.

## Google's pagerank

- Suppose we have a set of webpages $W$, with $|W|=n$ as the number of webpages.
- We define a connectivity (adjacency) matrix $A$ as follows:
$A_{i,j}$ is 1 if there is a hyperlink from page $i$ to page $j$ and 0 otherwise.
- Typically $A$ is huge (27.5 billion x 27.5 billion in 2011), but extremely sparse (lots of zero values)

## A small example

- Consider the small set of five webpages.
<center>                                                              
![](./figs/googleeg.png)
</center>

- The connectivity matrix is $$A = \left(\begin{array}{ccccc}
   0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1\\
   0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1\\
   1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\
   0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1\\
   0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0
   \end{array}\right)$$

## A small example
- The ranking of page $i$ is proportional to the sum of the rankings of all pages that link to $i$: $r_4 = \alpha(r_1 + r_2 + r_3)$.
- So this is a system of $n =5$ linear equations: $$r = \alpha A^T r, ~\text{or}~A^T r = (1/\alpha) r.$$
- The ranking vector is treated like a probability of relevance, so we
need to then rescale so that $\Sigma_{i=1}^n r_i = 1.$
- Go to R and compute pageranks.

## What you need to realise for now

- Finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a massive matrix is computationally challenging though (donâ€™t try to solve the characteristic polynomial!)
- and you will learn numerical techniques later.
